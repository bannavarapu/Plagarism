Maryada Ramanna is a 2010 Telugu action comedy film directed by S. S. Rajamouli starring Sunil and Saloni Aswani in lead roles.[1] This film is inspired from Buster Keaton's 1923 film, Our Hospitality. This is the second film for Sunil as a hero,[2] and is an important example of a director casting against the norm in the Telugu film industry. The film opened to favourable reviews by critics.[3][4]
